# House-Price-Prediction
House Price Prediction Modeling Using Machine Learning using (Linear Regression &amp; Gradient Boosting).

## Abstact
Hi!!. This project has two parts. The 1rst part evaluates the performance of two
machine learning algorithms (Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting) on the
Boston Housing dataset. The objectives includes predicting housing prices based
on various features and comparing the performance of the two algorithms using
metric such as Mean Squared Error (MSE). The second part evaluates the
performance of (Linear Regression) that i made from scratch and compares
itâ€™s results with the one from Scikit-learn Python library.

## Note
In this project i researched through Google, Youtube and other sources since it's my first time dealing with those libraries and the data used mostly isn't cleaned, scaled or balanced.
